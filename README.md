# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: Gabriela Liera

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

Android Kotlin Debugging is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!
There are 7 buttons with errors where I debugged using Logcat. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🤓🧠👩‍💻

## Notes

During this lab, I became familiar with finding errors using Logcat. I debugged ClassCastException, ResourceNotFoundException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and NullPointerException. 
In addition, I used my personal Android device to run and debug the application.
